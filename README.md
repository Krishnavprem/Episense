Episense  

Episense is my MATLAB + Deep Learning project for cattle skin disease detection.  
It can identify multiple diseases from images and also predict based on symptoms.  

What it does
- Classifies cattle skin images using CNN, DenseNet, and GoogleNet 
- Predicts disease from symptoms using Decision Tree + Eclat 
- Has a MATLAB GUI so it works offline, no internet needed  
- Trained on a custom dataset with 10 classes (including healthy cattle)  

How the project is organized
- `models/` → CNN, DenseNet, GoogleNet training codes  
- `symptom_analysis/` → Symptom-based prediction codes (Decision Tree + Eclat)  
- `gui/` → MATLAB GUI files  
- `docs/` → Reports, diagrams, notes  

Tech used
- MATLAB  
- Deep Learning (CNN, DenseNet, GoogleNet)  
- Decision Tree + Eclat algorithm  
- GUI design in MATLAB  

 Dataset
- Custom dataset with 10 categories  
- Healthy class has more samples → class imbalance issue handled in training  

 Demo
